# Connect Your Minecraft Account

1. You need a [Minecraft.net](www.minecraft.net) account to use Magikcraft. 

2. You need to use Minecraft version 1.11.2, so set up a profile for that version of Minecraft if you are not using the Magikcraft launcher. 

3. To download the Magikcraft launcher, visit [client.magikcraft.io](client.magikcraft.io).

4. Launch Minecraft, and connect to the Magikcraft server at play.magikcraft.io. 

5. When you get on the server, type in the following command: `/spellbook`.

6. You will see a link in your chat. Press the `T` key, then click on the link.

7. Choose 'Yes', and open the link in your browser.

8. You must open the link in the same browser where you are logged in to your spellbook.
