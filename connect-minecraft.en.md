1. You need a [Minecraft.net](www.minecraft.net) account to use Magikcraft. 

2. Magikcraft servers use Minecraft version 1.12.2, so set up a profile for that version of Minecraft. 

  * Here is a video on [how to do this with the standard Minecraft launcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZZlLqkapk0)

3. Launch Minecraft, and connect to the Magikcraft server at play.magikcraft.io. 

4. When you get on the server, type in the following command: `/spellbook`.

5. You will see a link in your chat. Press the `T` key, then click on the link.

6. Choose 'Yes', and open the link in your browser.

7. Once you have completed the above steps you will be setup to `/cast` magic spells in Magikcraft!
